But where are you going to, exactly?

The rush of blood in your veins,
the silent dark night,
the good but not really great food,
dirt on your hands,
the music, unpaused thoughts,
bitter sweet between teeth,
sweat behind your neck?

I'm going home now,
for I am free.
Free to love and live,
both equally,
both unconditionally.
