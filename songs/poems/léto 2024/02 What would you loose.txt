What would you lose,
if you would lose me?
Or rather, what would you gain?
What would you choose,
if you could choose free,
of any charge, of any pain?

Where do I go,
where do I lay down,
where do I cry, smile,
try not to lie anymore?

Just the best memory of me,
forget else all,
no more to say,
I'm on my way,
so long.
