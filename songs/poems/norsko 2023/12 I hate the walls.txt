I hate the walls.

Made of concreate, stone or steel,
they allow us humans to be inhumane,
so close to each other,
too close to each other,
while separating us even more,
more than any distance could.

Yet these walls hold this world of ours together.
Break the walls and everything collapses onto itself,
breaking bones and souls in the process.

How to get out of a prison,
you've built around yourself?
