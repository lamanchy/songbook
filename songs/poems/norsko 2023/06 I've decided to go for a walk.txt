I've decided to go for a walk by a lake today. It was sunny, beautiful day,
and I might for a swim later too.
As I was walking by the lake, well, in the lake, my feet in the shallow,
pleasantly cold water... Pardon me, I got lost in that feeling, it was
such a nice feeling - as I was walking, I saw a cute little fish.
"Hello fish" I said. I was alone for quite some time, so it was nice to have
somebody to talk to. "Hello human" said the little fish.
"I didn't know the fish could talk" I thought to myself, but immediately realized
that I said that out loud. I wasn't used to having somebody around, and I was
used to tell my thoughts out loud. "And I didn't know the humans can talk either. All
I hear them saying is: Jeg fanget en fisk!"
"I don't know what that means" I said.
"I don't know either" said the fish.
"You wanna talk for a while?" I asked.
"No, I'm gonna go hide myself now" said the fish.
"Okay", and off she went.
I wanted to tell her not to go, that all humans can talk and are friendly,
but I knew that wasn't true. Not all humans are friendly, especially to fish.
I was glad that the fish was hidden now, I was glad it was safe, it was a good fish.
Not even me, sometimes.
I wanted to tell the fish not to go, that I'm lonely! But that would be selfish
of me to keep her in danger. Could I protect her, even from me? I don't know.
Anyway, it was my responsibility, not hers, not to feel lonely, even when alone.
But I didn't go for a swim that day, even though it was a beautiful, sunny day.
