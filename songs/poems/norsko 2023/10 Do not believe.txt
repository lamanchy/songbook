Do not believe that all that you think is true.

Just don't do it.
Do not trust yourself.

Just how the way you feel changes everything around you.
Cause you felt bad yesterday, didn't you,
and the whole world turned sad and blue.
Yet now you're happy, and the world is still the same?
Yesterday, not so different from today, it rarely is.

Even what you see is just what the brain thinks you should be seeing,
not what's in front if your own eyes.
In science, there's no such proof as "I saw it".
Measure it, then, proove it.
Numbers don't lie, people will.

She's pretty? Prove it.
She smiled at me! Prove it.
She told me she loves me!
Even your memories are just a lie.
They change through time, like clouds in the sky.
Mostly still, yet never the same as yesterday.
