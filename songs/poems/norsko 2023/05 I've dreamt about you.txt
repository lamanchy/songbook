I've dreamt about you last night, you know?
Again.
And I don't mind, as long as I wake up,
as long as I know what's real.

I cherish that, the truth, even when it hurts.

Cause it hurts so good, like no dream ever will,
the dreams are just confused mind mindlessly screaming,
like preacher at the street who noone listens to.

The god will save you!

Nobody will, and I don't mind.
I've done my part,
the good, the bad, the silly, the stupid,
and I'm sorry, I really am, but that won't save me,
that won't save my soul.

There are hunters in this world, and those, who wanna be hunted.
And there are people, just people, too.
Did I catch you or did you catch me? I don't know.
I would like to be just a person, just one of the people,
just laying in the summer grass, laughing, next to you.

But I'm not.
Do you mind?

You've sent me an old-fashioned - not a letter - an email.
Who does that?
Well, you do. A compromise.

Let me just check my phone, yes, it really was a dream.
Just a dream.
