You gotta go up, if you wanna go down,
or was it the other way around?

You got to taste happiness,
before you can truly cry,
gotta breathe in,
before you can die.

And just like there's a bottom,
at the bottomless sea of despair,
there's also a top,
to the topless girls,
to your dreams,
to being always fair.

Cannot have it all,
but can't have nothing too,
you cannot always lie,
as can't be always true.
