Who are you, lady in the mountains?

The sea got its mermaids,
dark and as much fierce as beautiful.

The forest got its fairies,
innocent and lovely, guarded by the trees.

But who are you, pretty?

Although, who am I to know,
just a traveler, leaving, sadly, today.

Did you show yourself so I would come back?
I will.
Well, I would anyway.
