Like the highest mountain doesn't have the best view,
the prettiest girl isn't the most beautiful.

There's no reference, really, on the top of the world,
everything is deep below and there's nowhere to go,
nowhere but back down.

And they are treacherous, with steep paths dangerous
on the way up and lethal od the way back down.

Heavy rain and thick fog can appear any minute,
mood swings so fast and radical,
that even the most prepared can easily succumb.

But I'm and adventurous man,
and I'm here for the ride.

I love to watch the fog grow into clouds,
calmly pondering,
whether it means rain,
or the wind will take it away.

And I laugh, when the cold catches me of guard,
there's always more to learn,
there's always something new.

And, of course, I do enjoy the view from the top, why not?
The brief moment, just moment, when everything is perfect.
Just an empty pleasure, really, but pleasure still.

Just like the highest mountain doesn't have the best view,
the prettiest girl isn't the most beautiful.

But man, isn't it fun to climb up there.
