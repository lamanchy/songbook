The loneliness sets in fast and deep.
Why am I alive?
Or was it already there,
just hidden in a plain sight,
just a madman between clowns?

It's not that I was not expecting it.
It's not that I'm not welcoming it.
Bet you were not expecting that too, Laura.

Yes, my loneliness has a name now.
And I kinda hate it.
Well, let's get familiar, Laura,
you're here with me now.
