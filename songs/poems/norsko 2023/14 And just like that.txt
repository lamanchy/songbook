And just like that,
she is gone.

And it's not like I would mind,
not knowing where to start,
where she went to or if she's ever coming back.

I believe that she can find herself, her happiness,
no matter where she has gone to,
no matter how heavy the rain.

I love her.

The sun warms our skin,
but we are blinded by it.

Sometimes you gotta step into shadow,
to get a better view,
sometimes you got to run,
not to burn your skin.

Maybe we'll hold our hands again,
in the mountains, at our home,
or by the sea.
For now tough, let her see.
