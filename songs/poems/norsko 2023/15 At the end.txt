At the end of the night,
sun bright comes again.

There is no more pain,
the cold goes away.

I love you with all my heart,
you're kind yet in your own way,
sometimes you might, sometimes you may,
run free as long as it is a day.

Yet you return in the evening.

The feeling of blindness comes back,
as reliable as your own luck,
as all the qualities that you still lack.

Can't fall asleep, during the night,
fighting the monsters in your own head,
till either you or them are all dead,
you hold her tight, naked in the bed.

And at the end of the night,
sun bright comes again.

There is no more pain,
the cold goes away.

I love you with all my heart,
you're kind yet in your own way,
sometimes you might, sometimes you may,
run free as long as it is a day.
