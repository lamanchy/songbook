Imagination,
to see the mountains hidden in the clouds,
to guess the curves of your skin.

But as the mountains remain unseen,
the lake below is so clear and still,
that you might forget that there's any water at all.

No secrets, every detail,
the most beautiful sight I've ever seen.

What's yours most beautiful imagination?
Was it ever real?

As the wind takes away the clouds,
little waves start to distort the perfect image.

As the wind takes away the clouds,
the mountains start to slowly show their skin.

Now, what about you?
