With all of the world in your hearth,
is there a space for me still?

I wanna cry in your arms,
I wanna hear it's gonna be alright,
but I know that to these simple questions,
there are all but simple answers.

Nobody knows, what the future holds,
just time will tell.

I don't wanna get hurt again.
I don't wanna hurt you again.

You trust me?

When there's noone to believe in but yourself,
but you feel like a piece of shit,
what do you do?

You gotta start to believe, man!
