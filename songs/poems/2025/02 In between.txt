Do you _ me?

It would be easy to tell you that yes,
it wouldn't be true to tell you no.

It would be naive to tell you it's in between,
there would have to be a meaningful space for that.

There's just, oh just so many thoughts, opinions, memories,
broken bones and a heart full of love.
There's sunsets, sunrises, thunderstorms,
tears of too much and silences of too little.

And there's you and me.
What's in between?
