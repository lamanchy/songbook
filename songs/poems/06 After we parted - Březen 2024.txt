after we parted
there was a place of unknown
no sense of presence
no sense of sense
being lost
not beacuse I didn't know where I am
but beacuse I couldn't see what's around

I found myself, not long after
but what I see is not what I saw
and sometimes there's no way back
only forward, towards different
not necessarily better
probably not better

can't go back to see my grandparents
can't go back to you
can I go back to feel loved?
only foward, who knows
I certainly don't, and neither do you
so don't pretend otherwise
don't say it's gonna be alright
it's gonna be what it's gonna be
and that is alright
