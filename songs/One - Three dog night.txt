Em         G                            A      C H7
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one

No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number, worse than two

G             Hm                     Em
 It's just no good anymore since she went away
      C                  Cm               Em
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday

[refrain]
One is the loneliest, number, one is the loneliest
Number, one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest, number, one is the loneliest, number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

Bridge

[refrain]
One is the loneliest
(Number) One is the loneliest
(Number) One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do [4x]
