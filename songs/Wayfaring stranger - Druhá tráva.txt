           Am
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
                  Dm                  Am
While traveling trough this world of woe
Yet there´s no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go

[chorus1]
            F              C
I´m going there to see my father
            F               E
I´m going there no more to roam
          Am
I´m only going over Jordan
          Dm        Am
I´m only going over home

I know dark clouds will gather round me
I know my way, is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God´s redeemed their vigils keep

[chorus2]
I´m going there to see my mother
She sad she´d meet me, when I come
I´m only going over Jordan
I´m only going over home
