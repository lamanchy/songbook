Don't you worry, there my honey
F
we might not have any money
Am                                F
but we've got our love to pay the bills
C
maybe I think you're cute and funny,
F                             Am
maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you,
                   F
if you know what I mean

Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France
                        E
let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
    F                       G
and teach them how to dance
          C                  E
let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
       F                        D
making everybody look like ants
            C              F  G       C
from way up there, you and I, you and I

Well you might be a bit confused
and you might be a little bit bruised
but baby how we spoon like no one else
so I will help you read those books
if you will soothe my worried looks
 and we will put the lonesome on the shelf
