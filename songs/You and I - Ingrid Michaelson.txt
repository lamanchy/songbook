C
Don't you worry, there my honey
F
We might not have any money
Am                                F
But we've got our love to pay the bills
C
Maybe I think you're cute and funny
F                             Am
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you
                   F
If you know what I mean

    C                   E               F                          C
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France
                        E
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
     F                     G
And teach them how to dance
          C                   E
Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
       F                       D
Making everybody look like ants
              C              F G        C
From way up there, you and I, _you and I

Well you might be a bit confused
And you might be a little bit bruised
But baby how we spoon like no one else
So I will help you read those books
If you will soothe my worried looks
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf

[chorus] [2x], second time without guitar
