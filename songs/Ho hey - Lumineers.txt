C                                F/C
 I've been trying to do it right
C                               F/C
 I've been living a lonely life
C                                F/C
 I've been sleeping here instead
C                             F/C
 I've been sleeping in my bed
Am              G
 sleeping in my bed
C  F/C 2x

So show me family
all the blood that I will bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

®:
              Am                   G
I belong with you, you belong with me
               C
you're my sweetheart
              Am                   G
I belong with you, you belong with me
you're my sweet
C  F/C 2x


I don't think you're right for him
Think of what it might've been if you
Took a bus to Chinatown
I'd be standing on Canal...    and Bowery
And she'd be standing next to me

®

    F        G
And love, we need it now
      F        G
Let's hope for some
    F         C
Cuz oh, we're bleeding out
