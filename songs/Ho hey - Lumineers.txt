C                               F/C
 I've been trying to do it right
C                              F/C
 I've been living a lonely life
C                               F/C
 I've been sleeping here instead
C                            F/C
 I've been sleeping in my bed
Am              G  C F/C C F/C
 Sleeping in my bed

So show me family
All the blood that I will bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

[chorus]
              Am                   G
I belong with you, you belong with me
               C
You're my sweetheart
              Am                   G
I belong with you, you belong with me
               C F/C C F/C
You're my sweet

I don't think you're right for him
Think of what it might've been if you
Took a bus to Chinatown
I'd be standing on Canal, and Bowery
And she'd be standing next to me

[chorus]

    F        G
And love, we need it now
      F        G
Let's hope for some
    F         C
Cuz oh, we're bleeding out

[chorus]
