A
I just want to see you
D
When you're all alone
A                             D
I just want to catch you if I can
E
I just want to be there
         D               A
When the morning light explodes
E
On your face it radiates
  D
I can't escape, I love you 'till the end

I just want to tell you nothing
You don't want to hear
All I want is for you to say
Why don't you just take me
Where I've never been before
I know you want to hear me
Catch my breath, I love you 'till the end
I love you 'till the end

I love you 'till the end
I love you 'till the end

I just want to be there
When we're caught in the rain
I just want to see you laugh not cry
I just wanna feel you
When the night puts on its cloak
I'm lost for words, don't tell me
'Cause all I can say, I love you 'till the end
I love you 'till the end

I love you 'till the end
I love you 'till the end
I love you 'till the end
All I can say, I love you 'till the end
