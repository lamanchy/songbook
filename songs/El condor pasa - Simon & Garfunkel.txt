    Am          G              C
I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
                                  Am
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
                G             C
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
                                       Am
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would

[chorus]
 F
Away, I'd rather sail away
       C
Like a swan that's here and gone
  F
A man gets tied up to the ground
             C
He gives the world its saddest sound
             Am
It's saddest sound

I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would

[chorus]
