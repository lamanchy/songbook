         A                              G
When the stars shine bright through the engine's trail
        C        G            Em       Am 4x
And the dust of another world drops behind
        C                   G
When my ship is free of the open sky
       C         G         Em      Am 4x
It's a damn good day to my way of mind
There's a barren planet you never can leave
There's a rocky valley where we lost a war
There's a cross once hung 'round a soldier's neck
There's a man's faith died on Serenity's floor
      C                        Em       Am 4x
But I stood my ground and I'll fly once more
         C                Em   Am 4x
It's the last oath that I ever swore

[chorus]
A             G             D               A      E 2x
Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand
C             G               D                    A      E 4x
I don't care, I'm still free, you can't take the sky from me
Take me out into the black, tell 'em I ain't comin' back
Burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me
C                    G      A 8x
You can't take the sky from me

When you see a man and he's standin' alone
Well you might just take him for an easy mark
And there's many a man has tried his hand
And there's worse than wolves in the borderland dark
From the savage men to the government hounds
Try to take what's yours and tear you through
Ah but them that run with me's got my back
It's a fool don't know that his family's his crew
Don't you tell me what I cannot do
Don't you think I've got to run from you

[chorus]

When you've walked my road and you've seen what I've seen
Well you won't go talkin' 'bout righteous men
You'll know damn well why I want to keep to my sky
Never cry 'neath nobody's heel again
I've seen torment raked across innocent souls
Seen sane men mad and good men die
I've been hounded, hated, married and tricked
I've been tortured, cheated, shot and tied
You won't see no tears when I say goodbye
I've still got my family and my Firefly

[chorus]
