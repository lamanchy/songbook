    Emadd9
Hey you, out there in the cold
                                     Hm
Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me
    Emadd9
Hey you, standing in the aisles
                                           Hm
With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me
D                                         G D C
 Hey you, don't you help them to bury the l-i-ight
Hm            Am         Em
 Don't give in without a fight

[bridge]

Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[solo] Am 4x Em 4x [3x]

[chorus]
C           D      G  D C
 But it was only a fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
                            Em
And the worms ate into his brain

[bridge]

Hey you, out there on the road
Doing what you're told, can you help me
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall
