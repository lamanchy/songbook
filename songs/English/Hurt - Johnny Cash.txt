Am C D

  C          D   Am     C       D       Am
I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
       C      D     Am           C      D      G
Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything

[chorus]
Am              F   C              G
 What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know, goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
Am              F   C                Am
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears
You are someone else I am still right here

[chorus]
If I could start again a million miles away
I would keep myself I would find a way
