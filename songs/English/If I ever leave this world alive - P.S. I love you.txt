If I ever leave this world alive

I'll thank ya' for things you did in my life
If I ever leave this world alive
I'll come back down and sit beside your feet tonight
           G
Wherever I am, you'll always be
         Am          F
More than just a memory

If I ever leave this world alive

If I ever leave this world alive
I'll take on all the sadness, that I left behind
If I ever leave this world alive
The madness that you feel will soon subside
So in a word, don't shed a tear
I'll be here when it all gets weird
If I ever leave this world alive
