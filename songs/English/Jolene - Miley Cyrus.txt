Am

[chorus]
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
       G                                 Am | Am
Oh I'm begging you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your skin is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[chorus]

And I could easily understand
How you could easily take my man
        G                                 Am
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

And he talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying, when he calls your name, Jolene, Jolene

[chorus]

Had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene

And you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
Cos he's the only one for me, Jolene, Jolene

[chorus]

  Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
