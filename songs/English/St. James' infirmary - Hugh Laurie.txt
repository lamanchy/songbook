Em          A            Em
 I went down to St James infirmary
Em  C          H
 Saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table
So cold, so sweet, so sweet, so fair

Let her go, let her go, god bless her
Wherever she may be
She can search this whole wide world over
She won't ever find another man like me

When I die, bury me in straight laced shoes
A box backed suit and a Stetson hat
Put a 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So the boys'll know I died standin' pat
