 Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

And I say, it's all right

D                                 G               A7
 Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[chorus]

Little darling, the smiles returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

It's all right
