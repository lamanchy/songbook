G
Don't you worry, there my honey
C
We might not have any money
Em                                C
But we've got our love to pay the bills
G
Maybe I think you're cute and funny
C                             Em
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you
                   C
If you know what I mean

[chorus]
    G                   H
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents
 C                          G
Homes in the south of France
                        H
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
     C                     D
And teach them how to dance
          G                   H
Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
       C                       A
Making everybody look like ants
              G              C D        G
From way up there, you and I, _you and I

Well you might be a bit confused
And you might be a little bit bruised
But baby how we spoon like no one else
So I will help you read those books
If you will soothe my worried looks
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf
