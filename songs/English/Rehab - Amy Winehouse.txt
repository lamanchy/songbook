[chorus]
     A7
They try to make me go to rehab
I say no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
E7                             D7
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
     A7                    D7             A7
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

C#m                          F#m D                    F
 I'd rather be at home with Ray, I ain't got seventy days
             C#m                              F#m
'Cos there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
     D                     F
That I can't learn from mr Hathaway

E7
 I didn't get a lot in class
      D7
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

[chorus]

The man said why do you think you here
I said, I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near

He said I just think you're depressed
This me, yeah baby and the rest

[chorus2]
They try to make me go to rehab
I say no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know

I don't ever want to drink again
I just, ooh I just, need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
And have everyone think I've gone mad

And it's not just my pride
It's just 'till these tears have dried

[chorus]
