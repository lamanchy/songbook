[capo2]

G                   Hm
 I heard that you're settled down
        Em                      C
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[chorus]
  D                          Em
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
     C
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

G                 D                 Em C
 Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[chorus]

D                    Em
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
  C
Regrets and mistakes, they are memories made
D                              Am        Hm     C
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste

[chorus] [2x]
