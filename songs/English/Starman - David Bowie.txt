Fmaj7/E Cmaj7 [2x]

Dm
 Didn't know what time it was the lights were low ow ow
C
 I lean back on my radio o o
G                             G7
 Some cat was laying down some rock'n'roll
                    C Eb F
'Lotta soul' he said

Then the loud sound did seem to fa a ade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of pha a ase
G                           G7               E D
 That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive

[chorus]
          C       Am
There's a starman waiting in the sky
     Em               G
He'd like to come and meet us
       G7
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile, he told me
F          Fm             C          A7
 Let the children lose it, let the children use it
Dm             G            F
 Let all the children boogie
      C G C F C G
Na na na

Well I had to phone someone so I picked on you ou ou
Hey that's far out, so you heard him to o o
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel 2

Look out your window I can see his li i ight
If we can sparkle he may land toni i ight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in a fright

[chorus]
