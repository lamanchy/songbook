Em

G           D          G
 Oh, it's a mystery to me
          G          C              D
We have a greed with which we have agreed
        C                 D                 Em
And you think you have to want more than you need
  C               D               Em
Until you have it all you won't be free

[chorus]
     C                  G
Society, you're a crazy breed
                D             Em
Hope you're not lonely without me

When you want more than you have
You think you need
And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
Because when you have more than you think
You need more space

[chorus]
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me

[solo]

There's those thinking, more or less, less is more
But if less is more, how you keeping score
Means for every point you make, your level drops
Kinda like you're starting from the top
You can't do that

[chorus]
Society, have mercy on me
Hope you're not angry if I disagree
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely, without me
