[solo] Em | Em | C7 Cmaj7 | H7sus4 [2x]

Em                                         C7
You're mumbling words, but I can't hear anymore
                    H7sus4                       Em
You're totally entertained, that I am absolutely bored
To the sharks with your conversation see what they say
As you're thrown overboard and disappear into the waves

[solo]

Down to Neptune's kingdom and the ink black drink
Octopus bartenders, you can hear the mermaids sing
That'll teach you all to try and disobey
Here's a one way ticket to your watery grave and we say

[chorus]
Em
To all our enemies, we'll see you in hell
            C7                              H7sus4
We're gonna walk 'em off the plank into the wishing well
        Em
Down to Davy Jones' locker where the fishes sleep
           H7sus4                      C7          H7sus4
I won't be praying for you so don't be praying for me
To all our enemies, we'll see you in hell
We're gonna walk 'em off the plank into the wishing well
Down to Davy Jones' locker where the fishes sleep
           H7sus4
I won't be praying for you
            C7                H7sus4        Em
So don't be praying, don't be praying for me

[solo]

Keelhaul the prisoners until their skin turns green
Let the salts of the ocean wash them skeleton clean
Raise up those oars and let them fall
As the wind steadily sings you can hear the crew call

[chorus]
