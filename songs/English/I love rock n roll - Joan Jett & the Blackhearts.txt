  E5
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
                                H5
I knew he musta been about seventeen
    A5             H5
The beat was going strong
E5                  A5
Playin' my favorite song
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
                 H5
Till he was with me, yeah me
            A5
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
                 H5
Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'

[chorus]
E5                 G5
I love rock n' roll
   A5                      H5
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
E5                 G5
I love rock n' roll
   A5                          H5    A5   E5
So come an' take your time an' dance with me

He smiled so I got up an' asked for his name
That don't matter, he said, 'cause it's all the same
Said can I take you home
Where we can be alone
An' next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me, singin'

[chorus]

[solo]

     A5             H5         E5         A5
Said can I take you home where we can be alone
Next we'll be movin' on
            H5
He was with me, yeah me
             A5
An' we'll be movin' on an' singin' that
         H5
same old song, yeah with me, singin'

[chorus] [3x]
