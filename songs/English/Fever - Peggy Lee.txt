Am Am/C [6x]
Dm G Am Am/C

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night

[bridge]
Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago

Bm
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby you're my flame
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Gm
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, daddy oh don't you dare
He gives me fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his missus
Daddy won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
We give you fever, when we kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
