[capo4]

Am                   G
 Across the oceans, across the seas
F                C
 Over forests of blackened trees
        Am                  G
Through valleys so still we dare not breathe
F             G
To be by your side
F                  Am
 Over the shifting desert plains
F                 C
 Across mountains all in flames
        G                 F
Through howling winds and driving rains
G             Am
To be by your side

F               Am        F                C
 Every mile and every year for every one a little tear
Dm         Am                  Dm            Am
I cannot explain this, dear, I will not even try

Into the night as the stars collide
Across the borders that divide
Forests of stone standing petrified
To be by your side

Every mile and every year, for every one a single tear
I cannot explain this, dear, I will not even try

[chorus]
      F        G      F                   G
For I know one thing, love comes on a wing
    Am        G       C           F
For tonight I will be by your side
      Dm            Am
But tomorrow I will fly

From the deepest ocean to the highest peak
Through the frontiers of your sleep
Into the valley where we dare not speak
To be by your side
Across the endless wilderness
Where all the beasts bow down their heads
Darling I will never rest
Till I am by your side

Every mile and every year, time and distance disappear
I cannot explain this, dear no, I will not even try

[chorus]
And I know just one thing, love comes on a wing
And tonight I will be by your side
But tomorrow I will

[chorus]
Fly, away, love rises with the day
And tonight I may be by your side
But tomorrow I will fly
Tomorrow I will fly [2x]
