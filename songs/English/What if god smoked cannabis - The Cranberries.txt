   Em               Cadd9 G         D
If god had long hair ______and a goatee
And if his eyes were pretty glazed
If he looked spaced out
Would you buy his story
Would you believe he had
An eye infection

[bridge]
    Cadd9      D
And yeah yeah, god looks baked
Yeah yeah, god smells good
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[chorus]
        Em         Cadd9   G D
What if god smoked cannabis
Hit the bong like some of us
Drove a tiedyed microbus
And he subscribes to rolling stone

If god made this place, in the beginning
Did he plant any seeds
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve
So theyâ€™d be hungry for the apple
That the snake was always offering

[bridge]
And yeah yeah god rolls great
Yeah yeah god smells good
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[chorus]
What if god smoked cannabis
Do you suppose he had a buzz
When he made the platypus
When he created earth our home
Does he like pearl jam or the stones

And do you think he rolls his own
Up there in heaven on the throne
And when the saints go marching home
Maybe he sits and smokes a bowl
