[capo2]

             Am   Em          Am  Em
I've paid my dues, time after time
I've done my sentence, but committed no crime

        C        F            C  F
And bad mistakes, I've made a few
            C        G                 Am
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
    D         G
But I've come through
                                       A
And we mean to go on and on and on and on

[chorus]
D          F#m           Hm     G A
We are the champions, my friends
    D             F#m               G  H
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
Em                    Gm         C#dim
We are the champions, we are the champions
D           Em             F          G
No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions
       Dm   Em Dm Em
Of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
And we mean to go on and on and on and on

[chorus]
