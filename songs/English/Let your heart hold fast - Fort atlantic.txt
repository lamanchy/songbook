[capo2]

        G
All may days are spent
       C         G
All my cards are dealt
       Em  C      G
Oh the desolation grows
Every inch revealed
As my heart is pierced
Oh my soul is now exposed

In the oceans deep
In the canyons steep
Walls of granite here I'll stand
All my desperate calls
Echo off the walls
Back and forth then back again

     C             G
To believe I walk alone
     C                  Em
Is a lie that I've been told

[chorus]
            G
So let your heart hold fast
         C          G
For this soon shall pass
         Em        C         G
Like the high tide takes the sand

At the bitter end
Salt and liquid blend
From the corner of my eyes
All the miles wrecked
Every broken step
Always searching always blind

Never fear, no, never fear
Never fear, no, never fear

[chorus]
So let your heart hold fast
For this soon shall pass
There's another hill ahead
