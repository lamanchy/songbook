There’s a lady who’s sure, all that glitters is gold
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh and she’s buying a stairway to heaven

There’s a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there’s a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

There’s a feeling I get, when I look to the west
       C         G/H        F  Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen, rings of smoke through the trees
                                         G/H
And the voices of those who stand looking

[bridge]

And its whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn, for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter + [bridge]

If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow, don’t be alarmed now
It’s just a spring clean for the may queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There’s still time to change the road you’re on + [bridge]

Your head is humming and it won’t go, in case you don’t know
The pipers calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

 And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
Am       G               F
 To be a rock and not to roll
