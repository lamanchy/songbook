A            D    A               D
 I am an old woman named after my mother
A               D      Esus4               A
 My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were thunder lightning was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[chorus]
A            G         D              A
 Make me an angel that flies from montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam

[chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
Come home in the evening and have nothing to say

[chorus]
