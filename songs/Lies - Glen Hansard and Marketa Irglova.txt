I think it's time, we give it up
    C                 Am
And figure out what's stopping us
     F         C         F       C
From breathing easy, and talking straight
The way is clear if you're ready now
The volunteer is slowing down
And taking time to save himself

The little cracks they escalated
  C               A#      Am
Before we knew it was too late
    F      C           F       C    B/C
For making circles and telling lies

Am                D
 You're moving too fast for me
 G               C  B/C
And I can't keep up with you
Am           D
Maybe if you slowed down for me
G                  C    B/C
I could see you're only telling

Am          D
Lies, lies, lies
F           C    B/C
Breaking us down with your
Am          D
Lies, lies, lies
F             C     B/C Am
When will you learn

So plant the thought and watch it grow
C              Am
Wind it up and let it go
