C E7 Am Fm6/C C G C G7

              C    E7       Am     C9
Just let them talk, if they want to
F           G      C C9
 Talk don't bother me
F          G                Am               Fm6
 I'm gonna keep on 'til the whole wild world knows
C               G                  C         G
 That I really love you, I really love you so

And let them whisper, for they know not
What's between you and I
I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna keep on loving you
                       C9
Till the day that I die

[chorus]
F                G             C   C9
 They tried to break up our romance
F              G       C
 They didn't stand a chance
E7                                 Am      Amaj7 Am7
 We have the kind of love, that's so strong
D7                          G
 We'll be together from now on

They said that gossip comes from the devil's workshop
And only true love can make it stop
I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna keep on loving you
Till the day that I die

[ending]
            F          G                   Am Fm6
Oh, they're envious of everything that we do
                      C
But I wanna say it's wonderful
        E7
When you love someone
          D7               G
And that someone and that someone
        C       C9
Really loves you
[3x]
         F
And that someone and that someone
        C       C9
Really loves you
