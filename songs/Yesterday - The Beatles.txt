C        Hm      E7                 Am      Am/G
Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
F       G                       C
 Now it looks as though they're here to stay
G  Am    D      F  C
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

[chorus]
Hm  E   Am  G  F          G         G7         C
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

[verse2]
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

[chorus]
