[capo5]

       Dm
I have often told you stories
 C
About the way
  Dm
I lived the life of a drifter
Am
Waiting for the day

When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me and love me
And I would surely stay

[chorus]
F      G                Dm
 But I feel I'm growing older
B        C                 F
 And the songs that I have sung
A            Dm                C
Echo in the distance, like the sound
     F              B
Of a windmill going round
Gm                Am              Dm
Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune

[solo] Dm G Dm G Dm F G Dm

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you

But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

[chorus]

     Dm             C
Yes, I can hear the sound
     F              B
Of a windmill going round
  Gm                Am
I guess I'll always be
             Dm
A soldier of fortune
  B                 Am7
I guess I'll always be
             D
A soldier of fortune
