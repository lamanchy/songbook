[capo3]

       Em
I have often told you stories
 D
About the way
  Em
I lived the life of a drifter
Hm
Waiting for the day

When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me and love me
And I would surely stay

[chorus]
G      A                Em
 But I feel I'm growing older
C        D                 G
 And the songs that I have sung
H            Em                D
Echo in the distance, like the sound
     G              C
Of a windmill going round
Am                Hm              Em
Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune

[Solo] Em A Em A Em G A Em

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you

But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

[chorus]

     Em             D
Yes, I can hear the sound
     G              C
Of a windmill going round
  Am                Hm
I guess I'll always be
             Em
A soldier of fortune
  C                 Hm7
I guess I'll always be
             E
A soldier of fortune
