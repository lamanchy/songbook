             Hm  F#m
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
        D       G
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
            D        A                 Hm
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
    E         A
But I've come through
                                          H
And we mean to go on, and on, and on, and on

E          G#m           C#m    A H
We are the champions, my friends
    E             G#m               A  C#
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end

[chorus]
F#m
We are the champions
Am         D#dim
We are the champions
E           F#m
No time for losers
       G          A
'Cause we are the champions
       Em   F#m
Of the world
Em F#m

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
And we mean to go on, and on, and on, and on

[chorus]
