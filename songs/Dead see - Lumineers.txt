C
I stood alone, upon the platform in vain
Caug
Puerto Ricans they were playing me salsa
       F
In the rain
                           C
With open doors and manual locks
   F         Fm      C
In fast food parking lots

C
I headed West, I was a man on the move
Caug
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
      F
Oh, I need somebody, needed someone
        C
I could trust
        Am               G           F        C
I don't gamble, but if I did I would bet on us

[refrain]
         C
Like the Dead Sea
                           F
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
                               Am
You'll never sink when you are with me
   G              F       C
Oh Lord, like the Dead Sea

Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The nicest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

[verse]
You told me you were good at running away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
You took the rest when you took the map

Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live
It for yourself you felt, you just felt it was time
And I'm glad, cause you with cats, that's just not right

[refrain]

Am
 I been down, I been defeated
F
 You're the message I was heeding
D
 Would you stay
                   G
Would you stay the night

[refrain]
