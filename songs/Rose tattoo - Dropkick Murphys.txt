    Am                            C
The pictures tell the story, This life has many shades
    G                           Am
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
I’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
That smoldered in it’s tray
                         Dm               Am
Down a little something, then be on my way

I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn’t be alone

[refrain]
C                            G
Some may be from showing up, others are from growing up
Dm                               Am
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over, I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here, In a rose tattoo

     Am                C
In a rose tattoo, in a rose tattoo
              G                       Am
I’ve got your name written here, in a rose tattoo
This ones for the mighty sea
Mischief, gold and piracy
This ones for the man that raised me
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
This ones for our favorite game
Black and gold, we wave the flag
This ones for my family name
With pride I wear it to the grave

[refrain]

F                              C
This one means the most to me, stays here for eternity
  G                                     Am
A ship that always stays the course, an anchor for my every choice
A rose that shines down from above, i signed and sealed these words in blood
                                                          Dm
I heard them once, sung in a song, it played again and we sang along

You’ll always be there with me
Even if you’re gone
You’ll always have my love
Our memory will live on

[refrain]
In a rose tattoo, in a rose tattoo
With pride I’ll wear it to the grave for you
In a rose tattoo, in a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo, in a rose tattoo
Signed and sealed in blood I would die for you
