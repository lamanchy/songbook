G
 Been traveling these wide roads, for so long
                Csus2
My heart’s been far from you
                        G
Ten thousand, miles gone
Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
                Csus2
Every part of me
But there's blood on my hands
                       G
And my lips are unclean
In my darkness I remember
                           Csus2
Momma’s words reoccur to me
Surrender to the good Lord
                             Am
And he’ll wipe your slate clean

[chorus]
                                G
Take me to your river, I wanna go
         Am
Oh, ooh, oh
                                 G
Take me to your river, I wanna know

G
 Dip me in your smooth waters, I go in
     Csus2
As a man with many crimes, come up for air
                         G
As my sins flow down the Jordan
Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
                Csus2
Every part of me
But there is blood on my hands
                     Am
And my lips are unclean

[chorus]

[bridge] [3x]
        G
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
        Csus2
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know

         Am
Oh, ooh, oh

[chorus]
Take me to your river, I wanna go
Lord, please let me know
Take me to your river, I wanna know
