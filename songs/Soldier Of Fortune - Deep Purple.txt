Gm Dm C Gm

       Gm
I have often told you stories
 F
About the way
  Gm
I lived the life of a drifter
Dm
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me and love me
And I would surely stay

[refrain]
B      C                Gm
 But I feel I'm growing older
Eb       F                 B
 And the songs that I have sung
D            Gm
Echo in the distance
         F
Like the sound
     B              Eb
Of a windmill going round
Cm                Dm
Guess I'll always be
             Gm
A soldier of fortune

[Solo]
Gm C Gm C Gm B C Gm

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

[refrain]

     Gm             F
Yes, I can hear the sound
     B              Eb
Of a windmill going round
  Cm                Dm
I guess I'll always be
             Gm
A soldier of fortune
  Eb                Dm7
I guess I'll always be
             G
A soldier of fortune
