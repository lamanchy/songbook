What will we do with a drunken sailor

What will we do with a drunken sailor

What will we do with a drunken sailor

Early in the morning

[refrain]
Way hay and up she rises 3x
Early in the morning

Shave his belly with a rusty razor 3x
Early in the morning

[refrain]

Put him in a long boat 'til he's sober 3x
Early in the morning

[refrain]

Stick him in the scupper with a hosepipe on him 3x
Early in the morning

[refrain]

Put him in the bed with the captain's daughter 3x
Early in the morning

[refrain]

That's what we do with a drunken sailor 3x
Early in the morning

[refrain]

Way hay and up she rises 3x
Early in the morning
