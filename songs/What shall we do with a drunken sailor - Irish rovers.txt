Early in the morning

[chorus]
Way hay and up she rises [3x]
Early in the morning

Shave his belly with a rusty razor [3x]
Early in the morning

[chorus]

Put him in a long boat 'til he's sober [3x]
Early in the morning

[chorus]

Stick him in the scupper with a hosepipe on him [3x]
Early in the morning

[chorus]

Put him in the bed with the captain's daughter [3x]
Early in the morning

[chorus]

That's what we do with a drunken sailor [3x]
Early in the morning

[chorus]

Way hay and up she rises [3x]
Early in the morning
