At the end of the night,
sun bright comes again.

There is no more pain,
the cold goes away.

I love you with all my heart,
your kind yet in your own way,
sometimes you might and sometimes you may,
run free as long as it is a day.

You always come back in the evening.

The feeling of blidness comes back,
as reliable as your own luck,
as all of the qualities that you still lack.

Can't fall asleep, during the night,
you fight the monsters in your own head,
till either you or them are all dead,
you hold her tight, naked in your bed.

And at the end of the night,
sun bright comes again.
