                              Am7 Em7 G7 Am7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                           Am7 Em7 G7 Am7
It's not warm when she's away
                              Em7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                          Dm7
And she's always gone too long
                  Am7 Em7 G7 Am7
Anytime she goes away

Wonder, this time, where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

    Am7
And I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, hey, I ought leave the young thing alone
                                 Am7 Em7 G7 Am7
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
