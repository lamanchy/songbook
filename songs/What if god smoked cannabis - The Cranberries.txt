If god had long hair
A         E
 and a goatee
           F#m              D
And if his eyes were pretty glazed
A             E
 If he looked spaced out
          F#m     Dadd9
Would you buy his story
A            E
 Would you believe he had
   F#m   Dadd9    A E
an eye infection

And yeah yeah god looks baked
Dadd9     E
Yeah yeah god smells good
Dadd9      E
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
        F#m        Dadd9     A E
What if god smoked cannabis
        F#m       Dadd9      A E
Hit the bong like some of us
        F#m      Dadd9
Drove a tie-dyed microbus
A          E
 And he subscribes to rolling stone

If god made this place, in the beginning
Did he plant any seeds
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve
So they’d be hungry for the apple
That the snake was always offering

And yeah yeah god rolls great
Yeah yeah god smells good
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
What if god smoked cannabis
Do you suppose he had a buzz
When he made the platypus
When he created earth our home
Does he like pearl jam or the stones

And do you think he rolls his own
Up there in heaven on the throne
And when the saints go marching home
Maybe he sits and smokes a bowl
