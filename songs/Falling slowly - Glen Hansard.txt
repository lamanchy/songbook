C               F
I dont know you but I want you
C                F
All the more for that
Words fall through me and always fool me
And I cant react

Am         G      F        G
Games that never amount to more than they're
Am         G               F
meant will play themselves out

C                 F                 Am
Take this sinking boat and point it home
                F
We've still got time
C                  F                Am
Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
               F
You've made it known

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I cant go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And i'm painted black

You have suffered enough and warred with yourself
it's time that you won

®

Falling slowly, sing your melody
I'll sing it loud
