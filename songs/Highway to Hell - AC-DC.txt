A         D/F# G         D/F# G
 Livin' easy, livin' free
D/F# G      D/F#   A
 Sea-son ticket on a one way ride
Askin' nothin, leave me be
Takin' ev'rythin' in my stride

Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
                     E
My friends are gonna be there too

[chorus]
           A          D   G D
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
                      D
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around

Hey, satan, pay'n' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey, mama, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land

[chorus]
