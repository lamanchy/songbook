 So, so you think you can tell
                 Am/E                 G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain
                          D/F#               C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil
                         G
Do you think you can tell

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, What have we found
The same old fears, Wish you were here
