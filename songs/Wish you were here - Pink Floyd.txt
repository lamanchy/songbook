C                             D
 So, so you think you can tell
             Am                     G
Heaven from hell, blue skies from pain
                       D                     C
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
               Am                             G
A smile from a veil, do you think you can tell

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change and did you exchange
A walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found
The same old fears, wish you were here
