                Am
She took all my money and my best friend
             Dm                  Am
You know the story here it comes again
          E7              Dm
I have no pride I have no shame
                  Am
You gotta make it rain make it rain

Since you're gone deep inside it hurts
I'm just another sad guest on this dark earth
I want to believe in the mercy of the world again
Make it rain make it rain

Dm                   Am
 The nite's too quiet stretched out alone
E7                                  Am
 I need the whip of thunder and the wind's dark moan
Dm           Am
 I'm not Able I'm just Cain
H7                  E7
 Open up the heavens make it rain

I'm close to heaven crushed at the gate
They sharpen their knives on my mistakes
What she done you can't give it a name
You gotta just make it rain make it rain, yeah

Without her love without your kiss
Hell can't burn me more than this
I'm burning with all this pain
Put out the fire make it rain

I'm born to trouble I'm born to fate
Inside a promise I can't escape
It's the same old world but nothing looks the same
Make it rain, Make it rain

Got to make it rain
Make it rain
You got to make it rain
Got to make it rain
You got to

I stand alone here
I stand alone here
Sing it, Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
