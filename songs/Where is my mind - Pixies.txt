[verse1] ________________________________________
          G                        Em                H C
With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
G      Em             H       C
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
G                   Em                 H
 Your head will collapse, but there's nothing in it
           C
And you'll ask yourself

[chorus]
G            Em   H            C
 Where is my mind, where is my mind
   G      Em    H C G Em H C
Where is my mind
  G  H          C              Cm    Em D
Way out in the water, see it swimming

I was swimmin' in the Carribean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
But they told me, he swears
Tryin' to talk to me, talk to me
