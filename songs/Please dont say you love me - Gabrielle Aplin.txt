Am G | F C [2x]

        Am    G       F
Summer comes, winter fades
C        Am  G         F
Here we are, just the same
   C          Am          G            F
We dont need pressure, we donâ€™t need change
C         Am      G     F  C Am G F
Lets not give the game away

There used to be an empty space
A photograph without a face
But with your presence and your grace
Everything falls into place

[chorus]
     F                     C
Just please don't say you love me
         G                Am  G
'cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stopped skipping
When you look at me like that
There's no need to worry
When you see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
         G                 F  C
'cause I might not say it back

Am G | F C [2x]

Heavy words are hard to take
Under pressure, precious things can break
And how we feel is hard to fake
So let's not give the game away

[chorus]

             G
A fools rush in
                          C
And I've been the fool before
     C/H                A7
This time I'm gonna slow down
                              Dm
'cause I think this could be more
              C        F G
The thing I'm looking for

[chorus] [2x]
