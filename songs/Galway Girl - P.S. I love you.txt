Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
                F
Of a day-I-ay-I-ay
  C
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
               G     C
Of a fine soft day-i-ay
      F        C                F        C
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
           Am       G             F         C
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
      F          C           F        C
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
           Am       G           F      C
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

[solo]

We were halfway there when the rain came down
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
And she asked me up to her flat downtown
Of a fine soft day-i-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

[solo]

When I woke up I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
I've traveled around I've been all over this world
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
