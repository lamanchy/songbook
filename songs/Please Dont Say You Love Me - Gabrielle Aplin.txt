C       Am    G       F
Summer comes, winter fades
C        Am  G         F
Here we are, just the same
   C          Am          G            F
We dont need pressure, we don’t need change
C         Am      G     F   C Am G F
Lets not give the game away

There used to be an empty space
A photograph without a face
But with your presence and your grace
Everything falls into place

Just please don't say you love me
         G                Am
'cause I might not say it back
G       F                       C               G                 Am  G
Doesn't mean my heart stopped skipping when you look at me like that
F                   C             G                    Am  G
There's no need to worry when you see just where we're at
     F                     C
Just please don't say you love me
         G                 F   C Am G F C Am G F
'cause I might not say it back

Heavy words are hard to take
Under pressure, precious things can break
And how we feel is hard to fake
So let's not give the game away

A fools rush in
                          C
And I've been the fool before
     C/H                A7
This time I'm gonna slow down
                              Dm
'cause I think this could be more
              C        F  G
The thing I'm looking for
