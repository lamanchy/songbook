D            Dmaj7        D6           Dmaj7
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
D6           Dmaj7     Em           A7
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Em          A7         Em          A7
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Em7                 A7
 Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
Em      A      D  D7
 In the frosty air

[chorus]
       G                     Gm
What a bright time, it's the right time
   D               D7
To rock the night away
       E7
Jingle bell time is a swell time
A7
 To go gliding in a one horse sleigh

Giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet
                  H7
Jingle around the clock
G                     Gm
Mix and mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell rock

[solo]

[chorus]

Giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell [2x]
That's the jingle bell rock
