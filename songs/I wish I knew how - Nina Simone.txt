I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains that are still biding me
I wish I could say all the things that I say when I'm relaxed
And we start anew

[chorus]
I wish I could be like the bird in the sky
How sweet it would be to find that I could fly
I'd soar to the sun and looked down at the sea
G          B7 Em          Ddim G        B7  Em        G
 Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know _how it feels to be free
C          B7 Em          Ddim G        D9        G
 Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know _how it feels to be free

I wish I could share all the love that's in my hearth
I wish I could break all things that bind us apart
I wish you could know how it means to be me
Then you'd see, you'd agree, everybody should be free

[chorus]
