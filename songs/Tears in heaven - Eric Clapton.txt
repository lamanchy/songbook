A          E            F#m
 Would you know my name
D     A             E
 if I saw you in heaven
Will it be the same
if I saw you in heaven

F#m               C#m
 I must be strong
Em            F#
 and carry on
        Bm              E
Cause I know I don't belong
           A
here in heaven

Would you hold my hand
if I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
if I saw you in heaven

I'll find my way, through night and day
Cause I know I just can't stay
here in heaven

C         G              Am
 Time can bring you down
         D         G     D Em D G
time can bend your knee
C         G                Am
 Time can break your heart
         D         G
have you begging please
          E
Begging please

Beyond the door
there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
tears in heaven

Would you know my name
if I saw you in heaven
Will it be the same
if I saw you in heaven

I must be strong, and carry on
Cause I know I don't belong
here in heaven
