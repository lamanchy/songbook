       F                 Am         Csus4            C
She'll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees
    F                   Am      G         C
And make you thinks she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
But I still love her, I don't really care

F             C      Am    G
 When we were young, Oh Oh, we did enough
When it got cold, Ooh Ooh, we bundled up
It cant be told, Ah Ah It cant be done

It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love's indifference
Pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out
And I wont leave until you come downstairs

             F    C             G Am
So keep your head up, keep your l-ove
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

I don't blame ya dear for running like you did, all these years
I would do the same, your best believe
The highway signs say we're close, but I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, Ooh ooh we bundled up
It can't be told, Ah ah, it can't be done
