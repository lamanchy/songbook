Well you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                         Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              F                           C G
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you've let her go And you let her go

Am                            F
Staring at the bottom of your glass
       G                             Em
Hoping one day you will make a dream last
                Am               F      G
The dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you will understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

速

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But to never to touch and never to keep
Because you loved her too much
And you dive too deep

                Am
And you let her go
    F     G
Ooooo ooooo
                Am
And you let her go
    F     G
Ooooo ooooo
                Am
And you let her go
F G Em Am F G
