      F          Am  B          Am
I see trees of green, red roses too
Gm7         F     A7          Dm
 I see them bloom, for me and you
      C#              Gm7/C   C7         F   Faug Bmaj7 _______
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world _____C7

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
                                             B | B F
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

[chorus]
    C7                          F
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
      Dm              C             Dm          C
I see friends shaking hands, saying, how do you do
Dm              F#dim7  Gm7    C7
 They're really saying, I love you

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
                                            Am7b5 D7
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
      Gm7             Gm7/C   C9        F    B6 | B6 F
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world
