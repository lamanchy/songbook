Em7                  D              Cadd9            Gmaj7/B
 Across the oceans, across the seas, Over forests of blackened trees
        Em7                 D                 Cadd9         D
Through valleys so still we dare not breathe, To be by your side
Cadd9              Em            Cadd9             G
 Over the shifting desert plains, Across mountains all in flames
        D/F#              Cadd9          D             Em
Through howling winds and driving rains, To be by your side

Cadd9           Em        Cadd9            G
 Every mile and every year for every one a little tear
Am         Em                  Am            Em
I cannot explain this, Dear, I will not even try

Into the night as the stars collide, across the borders that divide
Forests of stone standing petrified, to be by your side

Every mile and every year, For every one a single tear
I cannot explain this, Dear, I will not even try

®:
      Cadd9    D      Cadd9                D
For I know one thing, Love comes on a wing
    Em        D       G            Cadd9
For tonight I will be by your side
      Am            Em
But tomorrow I will fly

From the deepest ocean to the highest peak, Through the frontiers of your sleep
Into the valley where we dare not speak, To be by your side
Across the endless wilderness where all the beasts bow down their heads
Darling I will never rest till I am by your side

Every mile and every year, Time and Distance disappear
I cannot explain this, dear No, I will not even try

®:
And I know just one thing, Love comes on a wing
And tonight I will be by your side
But tomorrow I will

®:
Fly, away, Love rises with the day
And tonight I may be by your side
But tomorrow I will fly, Tomorrow I will fly, Tomorrow I will fly
