Em7                  D              Cadd9           Gmaj7/B
Across the oceans, across the seas, Over forests of blackened trees
Em7                           D                 Cadd9 D
(Through) valleys so still we dare not breathe, To be by your side
Cadd9             Em               Cadd9              G
Over the shifting desert plains, Across mountains all in flames
        D/F#              Cadd9          D             Em
Through howling winds and driving rains, To be by your side

Cadd9          Em         Cadd9           G
Every mile and every year for every one a little tear
Am           Em                Am            Em
I cannot explain this, Dear, I will not even try

Em7                   D                Cadd9            Gmaj7/B
Into the night as the stars collide, across the borders that divide
Em7                       D          Cadd9         D
Forests of stone standing petrified, to be by your side

Cadd9          Em          Cadd9             G
Every mile and every year, For every one a single tear
Am          Em                  Am           Em
I cannot explain this, Dear, I will not even try

      Cadd9    D      Cadd9           D
For I know one thing, Love comes on a wing
    Em        D       G       Cadd9 Am   Em
For tonight I will be by your side

But tomorrow I will fly

         Em7                  D             Cadd9    Gmaj7/B
From the deepest ocean to the highest peak, Through the frontiers of your sleep
Em7                       D              Cadd9          D
Into the valley where we dare not speak, To be by your side
Cadd9              Em         Cadd9                    G
Across the endless wilderness where all the beasts bow down their heads
Am             Em              Am           Em
Darling I will never rest till I am by your side

Cadd9          Em          Cadd9             G
Every mile and every year, Time and Distance disappear
Am       Em                     Am              Em
I cannot explain this, dear No, I will not even try

       Cadd9         D/F#   Cadd9           D
And I know just one thing, Love comes on a wing

        Em    D        G            Cadd9  Em
And tonight I will be by your side
But tomorrow I will

    Cadd9   D          Cadd9          D
 , fly, away, Love rises with the day
        Em    D      G       Am    Emâ€¦
And tonight I may be by your side
But tomorrow I will fly, Tomorrow I will fly, Tomorrow I will fly
