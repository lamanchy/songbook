F                          C
 Day after day I'm more confused
F                                        C
 I look for the light in the pouring rain
F                                   C
 You know it's a game I hate to lose
Dm                         F
 Now I'm feelin the strain, aint it a shame

[refrain]
    C
Oh, give me the beat boys to free my soul
  G
I wanna get lost in your Rock-n-Roll
    F
And drift away
Oh, give me the beat boys to free my soul
I wanna get lost in your Rock-n-Roll and
Drift away

C G F G C

Beginning to think I'm was wasten' time
I dont understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm counting on you, to carry me through

[refrain]

C G F G C

Dm
 And when my mind is free
F              C
 No melody can move me
Dm
 When I'm feeling blue
F
 Guitars are coming through to
G
Soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along, making me strong

[refrain]
