G
 When I walk beside her
  F
I am the better man
C
 When I look to leave her
         G
I always stagger back again

Once I built an Ivory tower
So I could worship from above
When I climb down to be set free
She took me in again

[chorus]
          G               Dm
There's a big, a big hard sun
                  C                       G
Beaten on the big people, in the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back at me

Once I dug an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her bruise back again

[chorus] [2x]

When I go to cross that river
She is comfort by my side
When I try to understand
She just opens up her eyes

[chorus]

Once I stood to lose her
When I saw what I had done
Bound down and flew away the hours
Of her garden and her sun

So I tried to warn her
I turned to see her weep
40 days and 40 nights
And it's still coming down on me

[chorus] [2x]
