G
 When I walk beside her
  F
I am the better man
C
 When I look to leave her
         G
I always stagger back again

Once I built an Ivory tower
so I could worship from above
When I climb down to be set free
she took me in again

          G
there's a big
           Dm
A big hard sun
                  C
beaten on the big people
                G
in the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back at me

Once I dug an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her bruise back again

when I go to cross that river
she is comfort by my side
when I try to understand
she just opens up her eyes

Once I stood to lose her
when I saw what I had done
bound down and flew away the hours
of her garden and her sun

so I tried to warn her
I turned to see her weep
40 days and 40 nights
and it's still coming down on me
