Em7 D/F# G [2x]

Em7      D/F#       G
 Tell me something girl
C                      G        D
 Are you happy in this modern world
Or do you need more
Is there something else you’re searching for

[verse2]
Em7  D/F# G
I’m fall-in'
C                        G          D
 In all the good times I find myself longin'
For change
And in the bad times I fear myself

Em7 D/F# G [2x]

Tell me something boy
Aren’t you tired tryin' to fill that void
Or do you need more
Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore

I’m falling
In all the good times I find myself longin'
For change
And in the bad times I fear myself

[chorus]
Am                    D/F#
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G            D        Em
I’ll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
We’re far from the shallow now
Am           D/F#
 In the sha, shallow
G       D          Em
 In the sha, sha lalala, low
In the sha, shallow
We’re far from the shallow now

[Bridge]
Hm   D
Wooaaaah
A Em Hm D A
Woaaaaaaaaah
