Em7      D/F#       G
 Tell me something girl
C                      G        D
 Are you happy in this modern world
Or do you need more
Is there something else you’re searching for

[Verse 2]
Em7  D/F# G
I’m fall-in'
C                        G          D
 In all the good times I find myself longin'
For change
And in the bad times I fear myself

Em7 D/F# G [2x]

Tell me something boy
Aren’t you tired tryin' to fill that void
Or do you need more
Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore

I’m fall-ing
In all the good times I find myself longin'
For change
And in the bad times I fear myself

[chorus]
Am                    D/F#
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G            D        Em
I’ll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
We’re far from the shallow now
Am             D/F#
 In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G       D             Em
 In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We’re far from the shallow now

[Bridge]
Hm   D
Wooaaaah
A Em Hm D A
Woaaaaaaaaah

[chorus]
