Em D C H7

[chorus]
[2x]
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more (What you say)

Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)

[chorus]

Now baby, listen baby, don'ta treat me this a way
For I'll be back on my feet some day
Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
You ain't got no money you just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go (That's right)

[chorus]

Well
Don't you come back no more
Aah, what you say
Don't you come back no more
I didn't understand you
Don't you come back no more
You can't mean that
Don't you come back no more
Oh, now baby, please
Don't you come back no more
What you tryin' to do to me
Don't you come back no more
Oh, don't treat me like that
Don't you come back no more
