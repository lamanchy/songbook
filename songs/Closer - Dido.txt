   C
So leave your taxi waiting
                      F
And turn and close my door
    C
And sit back down where you were sitting
                       F
A little closer then before
C
When you look that serious
        Dm
It just makes me want you more

    Am        G          Dm
And I've been meaning to tell you

[chorus]
               C                 G
The closer you get, the better I feel
               Em              F
The closer you are, the more I see
             C           G
Why everyone says I look happier
             Em
When you're around
               F                 C
The closer you get, the better I feel

And yes I know you're nervous
Never seen you so unsure
You haven't touched your food tonight
And you're drinking more and more

And there's no need to hurry
Take you're time I'll still be here

And I've been meaning to tell you

[chorus]

           C            G
We've been circling for time baby
      Em             F
We're coming down to land tonight
    C                G
The wait is over and now it's easy
Em            F
Everything is fine

[chorus]

[chorus2]
The closer you get, the better you see
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier
When your around
The closer you get, the better I feel
