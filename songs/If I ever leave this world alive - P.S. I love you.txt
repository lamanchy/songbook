If I ever leave this world alive
     G                               D
I'll thank ya' for things you did in my life
If I ever leave this world alive
I'll come back down and sit beside your feet tonight
           A
Wherever I am, you'll always be
         Hm          G
More than just a memory
     D               A      D
If I ever leave this world alive

If I ever leave this world alive
I'll take on all the sadness, that I left behind
If I ever leave this world alive
The madness that you feel will soon subside
So in a word, don't shed a tear
I'll be here when it all gets weird
If I ever leave this world alive

D G D 2x

So when in doubt, just call my name
Just before you go insane
If I ever leave this world
           Hm               G
Hey, I may never leave this world

Now everything should
Be alright
