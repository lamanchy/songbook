Em | Em | C | G | G | G | G

Talking like we used to do
It was always me and you
Shaken up and shippin' out
Check me in and check me out

Do you like walking in the rain
When you think of love, do you think of pain
You can tell me what you see
I will choose what I believe

[chorus]
G        C/G
Hold on, darling
                                            G  Gsus4 G5
This body is yours, this body is yours and mine
G          C/G
Hold on my darling
                                       Em
This mess was yours, now your mess is mine

Em | Em | C | G | G | G | G [4x]

See you in the market place
Walking around at 8 am
Got two hours before my flight
Luck be on my side tonight

You're the reason that I feel so strong
The reason that I'm hanging on
You know you gave me all that time
Oh, did I give enough of mine

[chorus]

  Em               C
Bring me to your house and tell me
 G             D                 Em C
Sorry for the mess, hey I don't mind
       G                 D            Em C
You're talking in your sleep, out of time
         G                    D                D
Well you still make sense to me, your mess is mine

 This body's yours and this body is mine

 Your mess is mine
