        A
Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
                D
Of a day I ay I ay
  A
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
               E     A
Of a fine soft day I ay
      D        A                D        A
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
           F#m      E             D         A
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
      D          A           D        A
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
           F#m      E           D      A
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

[solo]

We were halfway there when the rain came down
Of a day I ay I ay
And she asked me up to her flat downtown
Of a fine soft day I ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

[solo]

When I woke up I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
I've traveled around I've been all over this world
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
