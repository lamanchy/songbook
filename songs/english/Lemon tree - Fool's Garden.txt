    Dm                Am
I'm sitting here in a boring room
     Dm                        Am
It's just another rainy sunday afternoon
    Dm                     Am
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do
    Dm                   Am
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you
    Gm                  Am     Dm    Am Dm
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

[chorus]
  F             C
I wonder how, I wonder why
Dm                              Am
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    B              C                    F         C
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
    F               C
I'm turning my head up and down
    Dm                              Am
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    B              G                    C
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree, say

[solo]

I'm sitting here, I miss the power
I'd like to go out, taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself to bed
Where nothing ever happens and I wonder

[bridge]
A           Dm
 Isolation, is not good for me
C           F              A
 Isolation, I don't want to sit on a lemon tree

I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and I will wonder

[chorus]
And I wonder I wonder

[chorus]
    B              C       B              C
And all that I can see and all that I can see
    B              C                     F
And all that I can see, is just a yellow lemon tree
