Hm
 I like digging holes and
Hiding things inside them
When I'll grow old I hope
I won't forget to find them
Em
 'Cause I've got memories and
G            A              Hm
 Travel like gypsies in the night

I built a home and wait for
Someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes
Head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and
Travel like gypsies in the night

[bridge]
      Em
And a thousand times I've seen this road
  G        A
A thousand times

[chorus]
            Hm
I've got no roots
For my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
For my home was never on the ground
            Em G         A      Hm
I've got no ro-ots, I've got no roots

I like standing still, boy
That's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from
I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and
Travel like gypsies in the night

I can't get the numbers
And play the guessing name
It's just the place that changes
The rest is still the same
But I've got memories and
Travel like gypsies in the night

[bridge]

[chorus] [2x]

[x2]
Hm
 I like digging holes, hiding things inside them
When I'll grow old, I won't forget to find them

[solo]
I've got no
No

[chorus]
