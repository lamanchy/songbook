G Am7 Hmb6/F# Am7

Home, is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I go numb, born with a weak heart
I guess we must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
We’ll make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
                               Em
It's alright, I know nothing's wrong
          G
Nothing’s wrong

Hey, I got plenty of time
Hey, you got light in your eyes

And you're standing here beside me
I love the passage of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight
Say goodnight

Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you or you find me
There was a time, before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be
Where I'll be

Hey, we drift in and out
Hey, sing into my mouth

Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal, looking for a home, and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead
Eyes light up, I see through you
Cover up your blank spot
And hit me on the head

Like, aye [3x]
