Oo-oh oooh [2x]

Black and orange stray cat sittin' on a fence
Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent
I'm flat broke but I don't care
  Am
I strut right by with my tail in the air

Dm        C           B       A
Stray cat strut I'm a ladies cat
I'm a feline Casanova hey man that where it's at
Get a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man
Dm
Get my dinner from a garbage can

_____________Yeah, don't cross my path

[solo]

Dm                            Am
I don't bother chasing mice around
  Dm
I slink down the alley looking for a fight
 H                            E
Howlin' to the moonlight on a hot summer night

Singin' the blues while the lady cats cry
Wild stray cat you're a real gone guy
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class and I got cat style

Am G F E Am
