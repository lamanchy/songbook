Am              G                 C
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls
And starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh and they come unstuck

[chorus]
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job
And heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh and they come unstuck

[chorus]

[bridge]
Am                           G
I just wanna, I just wanna know
C                                  F
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way

I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer
That you've ever seen, oh

[chorus] [2x]
