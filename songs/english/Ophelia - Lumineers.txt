Am      F           C
 Ah, ah, when I was younger
I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend she
Feels like she's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness

[chorus]
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move (whoo)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

         F    C           G       C    F C
Honey, I love you, that's all she wrote

[chorus] [2x]
