Hey, little girl is your daddy home
                                    C
Did he go and leave you all alone, hm
               Em   C       D        G
I got a bad desire, oh, oh, oh I'm on fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do, oh no
I can take you higher, oh, oh, oh I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby, edgy and dull
          G                           Em
And cut a six inch valley through the middle of my skull
   G
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
     C                  Em    C       D        G
Only you, can cool my desire, oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
C/E     D        G
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire [2x]
