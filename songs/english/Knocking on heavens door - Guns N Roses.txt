G     D                    Am
 Mama take this badge from me
G        D         C
 I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

[chorus]
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door [4x]

Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

[chorus]
