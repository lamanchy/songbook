Hm G E Em [x3]
Hsus2/D F#

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away I'm stolen

[chorus]
        Hm        Hm/A    G
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
G/F#    E          E/D         C#7b5       F#
We will stand tall and face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall and face it all together
At Skyfall

Hm G E Em [2x]

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
Hut you'll never have my heart

Where you go I go, what you see __I see
            Em         G              Hm
I know i'll never be me without the security
Hm/A    G            G/F#     E
Of your loving arms, keeping me from harm
         C7b5                      F#
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand
