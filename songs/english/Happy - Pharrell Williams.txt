It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

[chorus]
            Cmaj7
Because I'm happy
             Hm7              E11             E7
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Here come bad news talking this and that, yeah
Give me all you got, don't hold it back, yeah
Well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine, yeah
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why

[chorus]

Hey, come on
[bridge]
E7
Bring me down, can't noth'ng
Bring me down, love is too high
Bring me down, can't noth'ng
Bring me down I said, let me tell you
Bring me down, can't noth'ng
Bring me down, love is too high
Bring me down, can't noth'ng
Bring me down, I said

[chorus]
