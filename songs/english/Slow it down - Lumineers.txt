Csus2                      C
 I feel a filth in my bones
F
 Wash off my hands till it's gone
Am
 Your walls they're closing in
G                    Csus2 C
 With velvet curtains

Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

You're making noise in my street
My blinds are drawn, I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

[chorus]
F        Am
Slow it down
      G             C
Angie come back to bed
F          Am      G         Csus2 C
Rest your arms and rest your legs

Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

[chorus]

And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you

I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough for it

[chorus]

F           Am              G            C
Don't you frown when you're feeling like that
     Am       G               C
Only love can pick you out of this
