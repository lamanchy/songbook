G       G/F#   Em
 Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
C          G                 B7
 Seems to me like I'm just scared
          Em     D    C
Of never feeling it again
    G         B7        Em     D        C
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
               D
It's not that easy

I remember it now, it takes me back
To when it all first started
But I only got myself to blame for it
And I accept that now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy

[chorus]
But I've got
C      G       D                   Em      D
 High hopes, it takes me back to when we started
C      G             B7              Em       D
 High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
C    G      B7        Em      D      C
 High hopes, when it all comes to an end
                      D        G
But the world keeps spinning around

G | G/F# | Em | Em
C | G | B7 | Em D

And in my dreams, I meet the ghosts
Of all the people who've come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick
But they leave you far too soon
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of the gun
And I do believe that

[chorus]
And the world keeps spinning
How this world keeps spinning around
