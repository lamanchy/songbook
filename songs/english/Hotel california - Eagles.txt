Am7                       E7
 On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
 Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                         C
 Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm7
 My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E7
 I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself this could be
Heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[chorus]
F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California
       E7                   Am
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
F                               C
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Dm7                   E7
Any time of year, you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany, twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said, we haven't had that spirit here
Since nineteen sixty nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[chorus2]
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
Relax, said the night man, we are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave
