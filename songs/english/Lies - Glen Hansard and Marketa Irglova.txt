  G                   Em
I think it's time, we give it up
    G                 Em
And figure out what's stopping us
     C         G        C       G
From breathing easy and talking straight
The way is clear if you're ready now
The volunteer is slowing down
And taking time to save himself

[chorus]
    G                  F   Em
The little cracks they escalated
  G               F       Em
Before we knew it was too late
    C      G           C       G   G/F#
For making circles and telling lies

Em              A
 You're moving too fast for me
 D                G G/F#
And I can't keep up with you
 Em            A
Maybe if you slowed down for me
 D                 G    G/F#
I could see you're only telling

Em           A
Lies, lies, lies
C            G    G/F#
Breaking us down with your
 Em          A
Lies, lies, lies
C              G   G/F# Em
When will you learn

G Em G Em

[chorus]

   G                     Em
So plant the thought and watch it grow
G              Em
Wind it up and let it go
