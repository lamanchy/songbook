Em7             C
 Drink up baby, stay up all night
         G
With the things you could do
    D
You won't but you might
       Em7                    C
The potential you'll be that you'll never see
    G        H7          C
The promises you'll only make

Drink up with me now
And forget all about the pressure of days
Do what I say and I'll make you okay
And drive them away
The images stuck in your head

[chorus]
    C  D   Em7         Em/F# Em/G
The people you've been be----fore
Em/A Em/H C     D     Em/C#
That you _don't want around anymore
     C        D
That push and shove and won't
Em7     Em/F# Em/G Em/A Em/H C
Bend to your _will
              Cm
I'll keep them still

Drink up baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught

Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot

[chorus]
