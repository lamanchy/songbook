     Dm                 G
Some things in life are bad
         C               Am
They can really make you mad
Dm                G                  C
Other things just make you swear and curse
            Dm                G
When you're chewing on life's gristle
      C               Am
Don't grumble, give a whistle
    Dm                                   G7
And this'll help things turn out for the best

[chorus]
    C      Am          Dm     G7       C  Am Dm G7
And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle that's the thing

[chorus]

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it it's your last chance anyhow

[chorus]
So always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

[chorus]

Come on guys, cheer up
D      Bm          Em     A7       D  Bm Em A7
Always look on the bright side of life
D      Bm          Em     A7       D  Bm Em A7 D
Always look on the bright side of life
