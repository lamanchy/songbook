Em           Am            D                   G  D/F#
 Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've
I've been there before
Somethin' is changin' inside you
And don't you know

[chorus]
C            D    Em
 Don't you cry tonight, I still love you baby
C            D    Em
 Don't you cry tonight
C            D    G               D/F#    Em       D
 Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you baby
C                D    Em
 And don't you cry tonight

Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you, tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you
And the times we had, baby

[chorus]
And don't you cry tonight [2x]
And don't you cry tonight there's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight

 And please remember, that I never lied
And please remember, how I felt inside now, honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow

 Come the morning light now baby
