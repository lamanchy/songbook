 Am               G
Alas my love, you do me wrong
   F                 E7
To cast me off so discourteously
    Am           G
For I have loved you so long
  F        E7         Am
Delighting in your company

Thy gown was of the grassy green
Thy sleeves of satin hanging by
Which made thee be our harvest queen
And yet thou wouldst not love me

[chorus]
C                G
Greensleeves was all my joy
F                E7
Greensleeves was my delight
C                   G
Greensleeves was my heart of gold
F              E7        Am
And who but my lady greensleeves

Well, i will pray to God on high
That thou constancy mayst see
And that yet once before i die
Thou will vouchsafe to love me

[chorus]
