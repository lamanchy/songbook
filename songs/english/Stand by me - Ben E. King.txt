         C
When the night has come
Am
 And the land is dark
        F           G                C
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[chorus]
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[chorus]

So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble just stand by me
Oh stand by me, woa stand now oh stand, stand by me
