Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life
For me, and I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on a tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life
For me, and I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean
Don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this old world, is a new world and a bold world
For me [2x]

[solo]

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine and I know how I feel

It's a new life

It's a new dawn, it's a new day

It's a new life, it's a new life
    Dm E
For me

And I'm feeling good
