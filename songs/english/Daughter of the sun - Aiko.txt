C#m Ab A H

Daydreams never tasted so sweet
When I realised I'm living it
I feel, like I’m washed off the shore
Completely submerged into you
You’re in the centre of my world
My vision is blurred
I don't know what to do
I just gravitate to you
And I don’t know how to break through

[bridge]
I get scared
How deep I’m sinking
There’s no time for thinking
She’s the only one I want, my days don’t look the same now
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in
And let things happen

[chorus]
She makes me dance
She makes me wonder
What is out there ready for me
She drives too fast
She has a hunger for life
She’s the light, she’s the love
She’s the daughter of the sun [3x]
And if she leaves
I’ll fall back into apathy

I’m a survivor
Survivor of your love
Now I see the glass half empty
And I wonder if I’ll ever see it full again
Or is it a curse for having something so perfect

[bridge] [chorus]

I’ll fall back into apathy
Love of life of many
You remind me of my favourite song
And I play it on repeat
On repeat [2x]

[chorus]
