Em | D | Am | G D

Em     D      Am
 I was given wine
G      D           Em
 We're feeling okay
And quite all right
You wash my tears away
And make me wanna stay
And bonfires lit up the shores

[chorus]
Em                D
 Walk far far away
         Am
To go beside you
   G        D        Em
Is where I want to be
Walk far far away
To laugh, to love

[solo]

Days of roses and wine
Drifting astray
With your hand in mine
You stroke my fears away
And make me wanna stay
And bonfires lit up the shores

[chorus]

[chorus2]
Walk far far away
Where to go and hide
We're going to the sea
Way far far away
To laugh, to love

[solo]

[ending]
And this is how it went
I am here to stay
Roaring with the wind
There's life within

This is what I give
A circle is complete
Another circle spins
There's life within
Within

[solo]
