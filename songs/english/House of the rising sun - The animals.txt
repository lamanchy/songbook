      Am   C        D          F
There is a house in New Orleans
     Am  C           E
They call the Risin' sun
         Am     C       D            F
And it's been a ruin of many a poor boy
    Am     E        Am
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Deep down in New Orleans

Now, the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the risin' sun

Well, I've got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
