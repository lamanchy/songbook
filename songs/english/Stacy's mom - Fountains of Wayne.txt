 Stacy can I come over after school
We can hang around by the pool
Did your mom get back from the business trip
Is she there or is she trying to give me the slip

         C#m                           D
You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be
    C#m              D
I'm all grown up now baby can't you see

Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
      D      A               E          F#m
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
D               A               Fdim             F#m
Stacy can't you see you're just not the girl for me
  D                          E
I know it might be wrong but I'm in love with Stacy's mom

[solo]

Stacy do you remember when I mowed your lawn
Your mom came out with just a little bit of towel on
I could tell she likes me from the way she stared
And the way she said, you missed a spot over there

And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out your mom could
Use a guy like me

[chorus]
