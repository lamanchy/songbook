D                 Hm       Em       A
I don't know what love is, I can't say
What it is that makes me feel this way
But when I look at you it's then I know
                            Em   A    D
That I could follow you wherever you go

Oh, I don't know what love is but it seems
That every night you creep into my dreams
Then comes bright new morning and in my heart
I know it's one day closer to when we will part

[bridge]
    Em        A       Em       A
But then you come and then I know
     Em      A    D            A
That I won't ever want you to go

[verse3]
Oh, I don't know what love is, I never will
But when you're gone from me I know I'll still
Want you to be with me and wonder why
There never was a love for you and I

[bridge] [verse3]

You and I [2x]
