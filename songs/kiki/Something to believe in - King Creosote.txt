Am C F C [2x]

[verse]
Dreaming without sleeping
It's morning are you leaving

[bridge]
     E     Am     E    Am   G
But our story it has only begun
                          C
And are you willing it to end

[chorus]
                  Dm F C
You promised me a fee--ling
               Dm F C
Something to belie--ve in
                  Dm F Am
You promised me a fee--ling
G                  C
 Now promise to be real

[solo]

[bridge] [chorus]
