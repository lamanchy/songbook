Dsus2           Am C G
Remnants of the old
Visions of the new
Waiting on them both
Servant to the known and unknown

[chorus]
[2x]
        Am     C
It goes both ways
G          D
Past and future
        Am     C      G
It goes both ways at once

Listen to the bird’s call
See it in your mind’s eye, alive
Listen to that old song
Wonder what it means this time around

[chorus] [2x]

Look upon the face of it
See it with your eyes closed
Look at it in hindsight
See it in a different light

[chorus]
[2x]
We go goes both ways
Past and future
We go both ways at once
