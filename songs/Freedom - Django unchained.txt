C#m                                         A
Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders
C#m                                   E      B5
Pressure to break or retreat and then return
C#m                                  A
Facing the fear that the truth, I discovered
C#m                  F#
 No telling how, all these will work out
    C#m                         G#7
But I've come to far to go back now

                 C#m                  A
I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
       B5                           E    G#7
And to find it cost me everything I have
                       C#m                  A
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
       B5                             C#m
And to find it, may take everything I have

I know all too well it don't come easy
The chains of the world they seem to movin tight
I try to walk around if I'm stumbling so familiar
Tryin to get up but the doubt is so strong
There's gotta be a winning in my bones

Oh not giving up has always been hard, so hard
    A                                           B5
but if I do the thanks lase the way I won't get far

Mhm, life hasn't been very kind to me lately, (well)
But I suppose it's a push from moving on (oh yeah)
In time the sun's gonna shine on me nicely (on me yeah)
Sudden tells me 'cause things are coming
And I ain't gonna not believe
