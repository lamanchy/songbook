Am F Am F

Am                                          F
Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders
Am                                    C     G
Pressure to break or retreat and then return
Am                                   F
Facing the fear that the truth, I discovered
Am                   D
 No telling how, all these will work out
    Am                          E7
But I've come to far to go back now

[chorus]
                 Am                   F
I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
       G                            C   E7
And to find it cost me everything I have
                       Am                   F
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
       G                              Am
And to find it, may take everything I have

Am F Am F

I know all too well it don't come easy
The chains of the world they seem to movin tight
I try to walk around if I'm stumbling so familiar
Tryin to get up but the doubt is so strong
There's gotta be a winning in my bones

[chorus]

       F                         Am
Oh not giving up has always been hard, so hard
    F                                           G
But if I do the thanks lase the way I won't get far

Mhm, life hasn't been very kind to me lately, (well)
But I suppose it's a push from moving on (oh yeah)
In time the sun's gonna shine on me nicely (on me yeah)
Sudden tells me 'cause things are coming
And I ain't gonna not believe

[chorus]
