[Intro] G Em H C [2x]

[verse1]
          G                        Em                H C
With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
G      Em             H       C
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
G                   Em
 Your head will collapse
             H
But there's nothing in it
           C
And you'll ask yourself

[Chorus]
G            Em   H            C
 Where is my mind, where is my mind
   G      Em    H C G Em H C
Where is my mind
  G  H          C              Cm    Em D
Way out in the water, see it swimming

[Verse]
I was swimmin' in the Carribean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
But they told me, he swears
Tryin' to talk to me, to me
