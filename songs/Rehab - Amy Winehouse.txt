[Chorus 1]
     A7
They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
E7                              D7
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
     A7                     D7             A7
Just try to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.

[Verse 1]
C#m                     F#m       D                    F
 I'd rather be at home with Ray, I ain't got seventy days.
             C#m                               F#m
'Cos there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me,
     D                     F
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway.

[Bridge 1]
E7
 I didn't get a lot in class,
      D7
But I know it don't come in a shot glass.

[Chorus 2]
     A7
They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
E7                              D7
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
     A7                     D7             A7
Just try to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.

[Verse 2]
C#m                   F#m                  D             F
 The man said why do you think you here? I said; I got no idea.
C#m                             F#m
 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, lose my baby,
D                   F
 So I always keep a bottle near.

[Bridge 2]
E7
 He said I just think you're depressed,
D7
 This me, yeah baby and the rest.

[Chorus 3]
     A7
They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.

[Verse 3]
C#m                    F#m
 I don't ever want to drink again,
D                    F
 I just, ooh I just, need a friend.
C#m                   F#m
 I'm not gonna spend ten weeks,
    D                        F
And have everyone think I've gone mad.

[Bridge 3]
E7
 And it's not just my pride;
D7
 It's just 'till these tears have dried.

[Chorus 4]
     A7
They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
E7                              D7
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
     A7                     D7             A7
Just try to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.
